# Swing Player
This project is a music player implemented in Java Swing, utilizing Sqlite as the underlying database. It serves as a learning task for Java Swing in college, so the code quality may not be optimal. However, we are committed to putting forth our best effort to ensure its successful execution.

The music player encompasses features such as login, registration, managing favorite songs, and creating playlists. Additionally, it includes fundamental functionalities like playing and stopping songs.
